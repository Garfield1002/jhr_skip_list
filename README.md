# C++ Skip List Implementation

_You should probably favor of the more universal [C89 skip list library](https://github.com/Garfield1002/jrsl). Though feel free to continue using this library if you prefer fancy C++ notations_

> Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees.
> Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing
> and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are
> much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for
> balanced trees.

This is an implementation of the data type described in [William Pugh's paper](https:www.epaperpress.com/sortsearch/download/skiplist.pdf).

## üí° Why use Skip Lists

Skip Lists allow insertion, deletion, random access and search in O(log n) on average (and O(n) in worst case).
Skip lists are a simple data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees for most applications and are much less daunting.

## üìö Usage

The idea behind single-header file libraries is that they're easy to distribute and deploy because all the code is contained in a single file.
The .hpp file acts as its own header files, i.e. it declares the functions and classes contained in the file but no code is getting compiled.

So in addition, you should select _exactly_ one C++ source file that actually instantiates the code, preferably a file you're not editing frequently.
This file should define `JHR_SKIP_LIST_IMPLEMENTATION` to actually enable the function definitions.

```cpp
#define JHR_SKIP_LIST_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "jhr_skip_list.hpp"

jhr::Skip_List<int> lst = jhr::Skip_List<int>();

int l[]{3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 19, 17, 26, 21, 25, 1, 2, 4, 5, 50, 100, 18};

for (size_t i = 0; i < 17; i++) {
lst.insert(new int{l[i]});
}

lst.DisplayList();

```
